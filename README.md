## Escape Plan Game

Welcome to Escape Plan Game. In this game, we learn not only how to make the game logic of escape plan, but we make it multiplayer using socket.io and style it to the MAX!

In this project we include:

- Login Page - let user login to our game and store user information in database.
- Main Menu Page - let user create room and join room using room ID.
- Waiting Page - waiting for player to join and starting the game.
- Game Page - main page for playing our game.

We are using mainly Next.js and socket.io to make this project.

We are not be focusing too much on styling as this project is all about how socket actually work and to implement a simple socket programming client-server application.
